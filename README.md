# Operating Systems Frequency Distribution Assignment
This is a simple assignment that randomly generates a number, from 1 to 5, 100 times then calculates the frequency distribution of those numbers. However, the FrequencyDistribution class generates a random number based on a set of pre-determined percentages. For example, for the calculateNumber() method to return 1, the randomly generated number must be less than or equal to 5. As a result, this method should return 1 roughly 5% of the time.

I have also included a sample output text file named SampleOutput.txt. The Java files are located under FrequencyDistribution/src/frequencyDistribution folder.

I completed this assignment using Eclipse and have exported the project as an Eclipse archive zip file. To run the project yourself, simply import the archive named FrequencyDistribution.zip into your workspace using Eclipse.
